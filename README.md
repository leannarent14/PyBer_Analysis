# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to gather data about the ridership and fare metrics by different types of cities and to determine affordability.

# Results
Urban cities have the most riders and drivers, while rural cities have the least rides and drivers.
Urban cities have the cheapest ride for customers but the drivers make the least amount of money, while rural cities have the most expensive rides and the drivers make the most money.

# Summary
Overall the recommendation is to increase the number of drivers in rural areas to help the demand of rides and to lower the cost for the customers.
